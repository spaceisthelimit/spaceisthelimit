                    <p class="middle"> Mission & Goal
                      Reduce Animal Suffering
                      To find homes for every adoptable animal we take in. Whenever possible, help other organizations or rescuers with their adoption programs by providing foster care and posting available animals on our website

                      Bilingual Website
                      Create a bilingual website, so people, rescuers and organizations can use our translated information in a more effective way for education on and distribution.
                      Our materials are not translated word for word because some words that make sense in one language might not make sense in another. We always preserve the essence of the feeling and meaning of our material so we can help to reach out to communities more effectively

                      We hope by reading our educational material, people can have a better understanding of how humans and animals are all part of this world, when animals become extinct, human extinction won’t be too far along. We hope our material can open people’s heart and learn how to respect all animals and nature that we share on this earth. They too can become an important part of our expansion and teach their families and friends what they learn.
