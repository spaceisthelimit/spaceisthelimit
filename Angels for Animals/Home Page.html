                    <p class="middle"> We are changing our organization's name from Asians for Humans, Animals & Nature to Angels for Humans, Animals & Nature. The abbreviation and the website will remain the same as www.ahan.org.<br>
                    We believe that all the people whom rescue animals, find homes for these animals and adopt these animals are all angels. Since it doesn't matter which people help animals, as they are all angels, we felt Angels for Humans, Animals & Nature is now a much more appropriate name.<br>
                    We also intend to reach out to people to help them become healthier by providing information that will improve their overall health. We believe when we are healthy, the way we think and act will have a much more positive atttude toward everything that we do. With improved health and a healthy outlook, we can influence people around us to create a more peaceful environment on earth.<br>
